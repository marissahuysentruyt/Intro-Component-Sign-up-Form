## Welcome üëã

This is a fairly typical looking sign-up form. I built this in Angular to continue honing my skills in that framework, using `FormBuilder` and `Reactive Forms`. 

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## Where to find everything

If you would like to see the static design files, you may find them in the `/design` folder. You'll see both a mobile and a desktop version. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information regarding the designs, such as color palette and fonts.

## Running This Project

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to get all dependencies
3. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to ensure you have the `@angular/cli` package installed globally
4. Double check that you are using the correct Node version. I recommend 18.10 (you will get output from the terminal if you're using an incorrect version)
5. `ng serve` will build your project
6. Go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/) to see the build
7. `ng test` triggers your tests in 'watch' mode with the default [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) test runner.

## My process

I have built this project before, but with plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This time around, I wanted to practice my refactoring skills by transferring it to Angular, using SCSS, and starting with the mobile designs first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->

### What I learned

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - If you've never used Angular before, here are the docs. They're pretty comprehensive. üëç Particularly for this project, the built-in Angular Validators were super useful!
